# 🍳 Chef AI - Recipe Generator

An intelligent, full-stack recipe generation workspace. **Chef AI** leverages machine learning to transform user-provided ingredients, nutritional targets, or meal types into structured, actionable cooking instructions.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

This application is engineered as a decoupled system to ensure a clean separation of concerns between the user interface and the machine learning inference engine.

* **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite (Custom responsive glass-morphism design).
* **Backend:** Python 3.x + FastAPI.
* **AI Engine:** HuggingFace / Local Llama Models.
* **Assets:** Unsplash API for dynamic food imagery.

## 📚 Documentation

Detailed technical documentation and installation guides are maintained in dedicated files:

## 🛣️ Roadmap

### Phase 1: Data & Model Engineering (Python)
* **Data Extraction:** Develop Python scripts to scrape and clean raw text from PDF/eBook sources.
* **Dataset Preparation:** Convert cleaned text into structured .jsonl files for LLM fine-tuning.
* **Model Training:** Fine-tune Llama 3/Mistral on custom culinary datasets using Unsloth/HuggingFace.
* **Inference Optimization:** Implement GGUF quantization for faster local response times.

### Phase 2: Full-Stack Integration
* **API Logic:** Connect the fine-tuned model to the FastAPI POST /generate endpoint.
* **CORS & Security:** Configure middleware to allow secure communication between services.
* **State Management:** Implement LocalStorage in React to persist user recipe history.
* **Error Handling:** Add robust try/except blocks for API timeouts and model inference failures.

### Phase 3: Containerization & DevOps
* **Dockerization:** Write Dockerfiles for both Frontend and Backend to ensure environment parity.
* **Orchestration:** Use docker-compose to launch the entire stack with a single command.
* **Environment Control:** Standardize .env management across local and production builds.

### Phase 4: Deployment & Scaling
* **Backend (Render):** Deploy the FastAPI server with a persistent disk for model weights.
* **Frontend (Vercel):** Deploy the React/Vite UI to Vercel for global edge-network delivery.
* **Automated CI/CD:** Set up GitHub Actions to trigger deployments on every successful Pull Request merge.
